  "description": "- What was your motivation?\r - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.\")\r - What problem does it solve?\r - What did you learn?\r ## Table of Contents \r If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.\r - [Installation](#installation)\r - [Usage](#usage)\r - [Credits](#credits)\r - [License](#license)\r ## Installation\r What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.\r ## Usage\r Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.\r To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:\r     ```md\r     ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)\r     ```\r ## Credits\r List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.\r If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.\r If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.\r ## License\r The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).\r ---\r üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.\r ## Badges\r ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)\r Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.\r ## Features\r If your project has a lot of features, list them here.\r ## How to Contribute\r If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.\r ## Tests\r Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here",
